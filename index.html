                <h2>Neymar Jr</h2>
                <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional
                    footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team.
                    He is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.[7]

                    Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the
                    club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa
                    Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American
                    Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of
                    Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the continental treble of La
                    Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or
                    in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. In 2017,
                    Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth €222 million, making him the most
                    expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, Neymar won three league titles, three Coupe de France, and
                    two Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year
                    in his debut season.[10] Neymar helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and
                    led the club to its first ever Champions League Final.</p>

                    a German professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder and is the captain of Turkish
                    Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe. Özil is known for his technical skills, creativity, passing skills, and
                    vision.[2] He can also play as a wide midfielder.

                    Born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Özil began his senior club career playing for hometown club
                    Schalke 04, before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his
                    first season, his individual performances led to a move to Real Madrid in 2010.[3] There, he helped
                    the club win a La Liga title, and ranked first in league assists for three straight seasons.[4] In
                    2013, Özil was the subject of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for

                    drought, while recording the second most assists ever (19) in a Premier League season. In 2021, Özil
                    joined Fenerbahçe on a free transfer.[5]</p>

                    football transfer when he signed for Liverpool for £36.9 million, becoming the most expensive
